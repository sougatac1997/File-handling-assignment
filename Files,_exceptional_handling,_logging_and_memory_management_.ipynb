        "#Theory\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**  \n",
        "   - Interpreted languages are executed line by line by an interpreter, whereas compiled languages are translated into machine code by a compiler before execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is exception handling in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Exception handling is a mechanism in Python to handle runtime errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to ensure the program runs smoothly even when errors occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is the purpose of the `finally` block in exception handling?**  \n",
        "   - The `finally` block ensures that certain code runs regardless of whether an exception was raised or not, typically for cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What is logging in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Logging is a way to track events or messages in a program, which helps in debugging, monitoring, and understanding the flow of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**  \n",
        "   - The `__del__` method is called when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing it to release resources or perform cleanup tasks before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What is the difference between `import` and `from ... import` in Python?**  \n",
        "   - `import` imports the entire module, while `from ... import` allows you to import specific attributes or functions directly from the module.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**  \n",
        "   - You can handle multiple exceptions by using multiple `except` blocks or by specifying a tuple of exception types in a single `except` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is the purpose of the `with` statement when handling files in Python?**  \n",
        "   - The `with` statement ensures that a file is properly closed after its block of code is executed, even if an exception occurs, simplifying file handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**  \n",
        "   - Multithreading allows concurrent execution within a single process, sharing the same memory space, while multiprocessing runs separate processes with independent memory spaces, enabling true parallelism.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**  \n",
        "    - Logging helps track the program’s behavior, aids in debugging, monitors application health, and provides a record of events for troubleshooting and auditing.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is memory management in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Memory management in Python involves automatically allocating and freeing memory, including garbage collection to remove unused objects and optimize memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**  \n",
        "    - The basic steps are: `try` block to execute code, `except` block to handle exceptions, `else` block for code that runs if no exception occurs, and `finally` for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Why is memory management important in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Efficient memory management ensures that the program does not consume excessive memory, preventing memory leaks and improving performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **What is the role of `try` and `except` in exception handling?**  \n",
        "    - The `try` block contains code that might raise an error, while the `except` block catches and handles the error, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **How does Python's garbage collection system work?**  \n",
        "    - Python’s garbage collection automatically manages memory by tracking object references and freeing memory used by objects that are no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What is the purpose of the `else` block in exception handling?**  \n",
        "    - The `else` block runs if no exception is raised in the `try` block, allowing the execution of code when no errors occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **What are the common logging levels in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Common logging levels are `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL`, which indicate the severity of logged messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What is the difference between `os.fork()` and multiprocessing in Python?**  \n",
        "    - `os.fork()` creates a child process that is a copy of the parent process, while multiprocessing creates independent processes that can run concurrently with separate memory spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Closing a file ensures that all data is written, resources are freed, and file handles are properly released, preventing data corruption and memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **What is the difference between `file.read()` and `file.readline()` in Python?**  \n",
        "    - `file.read()` reads the entire content of the file, while `file.readline()` reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **What is the logging module in Python used for?**  \n",
        "    - The logging module is used to log messages and events within a program, helping to track its execution, troubleshoot issues, and monitor its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **What is the `os` module in Python used for in file handling?**  \n",
        "    - The `os` module provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as file and directory manipulation, working with paths, and managing system resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Challenges include managing circular references, handling large objects, preventing memory leaks, and optimizing memory usage in long-running programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**  \n",
        "    - You can raise an exception manually by using the `raise` keyword followed by an exception class, like `raise ValueError(\"An error occurred\")`.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. **Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**  \n",
        "    - Multithreading is important in applications that need to perform I/O-bound tasks concurrently, improving efficiency and responsiveness by allowing multiple tasks to run at the same time without blocking each other."
